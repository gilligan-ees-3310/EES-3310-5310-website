## Catalog Description

**EES 3310/5310 Global Climate Change**
Scientific principles and policy applications. Earth's past; evidence of human
impact; future climate change; and economic, social, and ecological
consequences. Economic, technological, and public policy responses.

### Prerequisites

Prerequisite: one of 1030, 1080, 1510, 1510, CHEM 1601, ECON 1010, ES 1401 or
PHYS 1501, 1601, 1901. \[4\] \(MNS\)

Essentially, the pre-requisite is there to ensure that you are comfortable
with quantitative methods in natural or social science or engineering.
I expect you to be comfortable with using algebra to solve problems and that
you are familiar with basic statistics.

The course does not expect calculus or advanced math.

If you believe that you have these skills, but have not taken one of the
pre-requisites, please see me and I will be happy to make an exception.

### Repeat Credit

Repeat credit for 2110. Students who have earned credit for 2110 will earn only
one credit hour for this course.

## Narrative Description

This course will study earth's climate and the way it has changed throughout
our planet's history. We will study:

* Determinants of climate: What factors affect climate, how do we know this,
  and how certain are we?
* Scientific evidence about past climates: What do we know, how do we know it,
  and how certain are we?
* Natural climate change in earth's history.
* Effects of human activity on global climate in the last 200 years.
* What do we know about future climate change and how will it affect the
  quality of people's lives?
* How do economists and political scientists assess the costs of climate change
  and the value of policies to limit it?
* What can we do to mitigate future global climate change or adapt to life in a
  different climate?
* What is happening politically, both in the U.S. and internationally, to
  respond to climate change?

## Goals for the Course

My goals for this course are that at the end of the semester:

* You will have a solid quantitative understanding of the basic physical and
  chemical principles that control the system and be able to apply that
  knowledge to reasoning about the climate system and its response to
  disturbances.
* You will have working familiarity with a variety of computer models that
  simulate various aspects of the climate system and be able to use those
  models to explore the implications of scientific principles that are too
  complex to calculate with pencil and paper.
* You will have a solid scientific understanding of what scientists know, what
  they don't know, and how they know what they know about how climate works,
  how and why it has changed in the past, and how it may change in the future.
* You will be able to evaluate the evidence for and against the idea that human
  activity is warming the planet and assess for yourself whether the evidence
  is persuasive.
* You will be familiar with the ways economists and policy analysts approach
  the problem of climate change and public policies that respond to it.
* You will understand the history of scientific and political concern and
  activity around global warming, the principal policy measures being
  considered to address climate change, and their major strengths and
  weaknesses.
* You will have the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions about what
  climate policies you support or oppose.
* In the laboratory, you will learn to:
    * Use simple climate models to explore the dynamics of the climate system.
    * Use open-source statistical tools to download and analyze real climate data.
    * Follow established reproducible research practices.

When you leave this course, you will not be qualified to work as a climate
scientist, but you will be able to follow and critically evaluate news
reporting about climate change and climate policy, debate intelligently and
knowledgeably, and be an informed voter.

I do not care whether you agree with me politically. I respect people who think
for themselves.
**What counts is whether you can present your own position clearly and support
it with solid evidence and reasoned argument.**

# **Structure of the Course:**

I divide the semester into two parts:

1. **Scientific Principles of Climate:** For the first half of the semester, we
   will focus on the scientific principles of climate and natural climate
   change in earth's past. This will be very mathematical, using basic algebra.
   We do not use calculus or other advanced math in this class, but you should
   be comfortable with simple algebraic equations. We will then look at climate
   change in the last two centuries and what might happen over the next several
   centuries. We will emphasize examining the scientific evidence to understand
   what it can and cannot tell us.
2. **Human Dimensions of Climate Change: Politics, Economics, etc.:** For the
   second half of the semester, we will focus on the political, economic, and
   social aspects of climate change and possible public policy and
   technological responses.

## Laboratory

The laboratory section of this course is very important.
In the first half of the semester, you will use interactive computer models of
the climate system to explore the implications of principles that we cover in
class and in the reading, practice downloading and analyzing real climate data,
and learning about best practices for reproducible research in order to make
your work reliable, reproducible, and trustworthy.

In the second half, you will use computational tools to explore the challenges
of replacing fossil fuels with clean energy (renewable or nuclear), conduct
quantitative economic analyses of different kinds of climate policies, and
engage in role-playing exercises to simulate the way different climate policies
work in practice.

To make the laboratory sessions effective, it is essential that you show up on
time and prepared for the labs.

{{< TA_TITLE >}} and {{< PROF_TITLE >}} will both have office hours
when you can drop in and discuss the laboratories, and I recommend that you
take advantage of our office hours to get help if you have difficulty with any
part of the lab.

**I recommend that you read all of the reading material for the lab
before you come to lab.**
You will get much more out of the labs if you are prepared.


# Reading Material

There are three required textbooks and one recommended book.
I will also assign supplementary reading on the Internet or in handouts 
during the term and I will post these on Brightspace.

## Required Textbooks:

* {{< LONG_ARCHER >}}.
  Be sure you get the second edition because it is significantly different
  from the first.
* {{< LONG_NORDHAUS >}}.
* {{< LONG_PIELKE >}}.

There is a companion web site to {{< MEDIUM_ARCHER >}} at
[climatemodels.uchicago.edu](https://climatemodels.uchicago.edu),
which includes interactive online computer models that we will use for some
exercises in the book.

### Optional Textbook:

* {{< LONG_WICKHAM >}}. This book gives a great introduction to using R for
  analyzing data, aimed at newcomers and beginners. The book is available in 
  print, but you can also read the whole thing online for free 
  at <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/>
  
  You do not need to read this book, but it may be very helpful as you are 
  learning R. It focuses on explaining how to use the "`tidyverse`" group
  of R tools that we will be using extensively in lab.

## Overview of Reading Materials

I will give out detailed reading that give specific pages to read for each class
and notes on important things you should understand. **I expect you to complete
the reading before you come to class on the day for which the reading is
assigned**, so you can participate in discussions of the assigned material and
ask questions if there are things you don't understand.

While science aims to give correct answers to scientific questions, there are
not right or wrong answers to questions of what is the best economic model with
which to assess the costs of climate change or the best policy with which to
respond to climate change, so I have chosen books and other reading material
that present different points of view on the political and economic aspects.

## Class Web Site

In addition to the {{< BRIGHTSPACE >}} web site, I have set up a server at
{{< CLASS_WEB_SITE >}},
where I post the web versions of class slides and interactive web-based
applications to that can be useful for working with data output from agent-based
modeling experiments.

## Computer Software

For the laboratory, we will use four principal software tools:

* **{{< RSTATS >}}** is a powerful tool for statistical analysis.
* **{{< RSTUDIO >}}** provides an interactive environment for
  working with R. Using {{< RSTUDIO >}} makes R much more user-friendly and
  easy to work with.
* **{{< GIT >}}** is a tool that helps you manage your work by keeping track of the
  changes you make as you write and edit text and analysis code, and it also
  helps you easily back up your work and synchronize it across multiple
  computers, including coordinating working together with a partner.

    {{< GIT >}} integrates into RStudio, which makes it easier to use.

    We will also use a web-based service called **{{< GITHUB >}}**, which lets you
    easily save your work in the cloud (useful for backing it up in case
    something happens to your computer). {{< GITHUB >}} is free for
    open-source software projects, and students can also get a free account for
    class work and personal projects.

* **{{< LATEX >}}** is a powerful typesetting tool. You won't use this directly,
  but RMarkdown uses it behind the scenes to produce PDF documents.
  RMarkdown also allows you to produce web pages, and Word documents so
  using {{< LATEX >}} will be optional for this course.

Details about the software and how to install it are included in the
documentation for the first laboratory session.

Part of the assignment for the first lab is to install the necessary software
({{< RSTATS >}}, {{< RSTUDIO >}}, and {{< GIT >}}) on your computer before the
first lab, so please read the lab instructions and get an early start on this.

# **Assignments**

### Overview of reading assignments

I will give out detailed reading that give specific pages to read for each class
and notes on important things you should understand.
**I expect you to complete the reading before you come to class on the day
for which the reading is assigned**,
so you can participate in discussions of the
assigned material and ask questions if there are things you don't understand.

### **Lab Assignments**

Lab assignments have two parts: First, there will be reading and sometimes
some simple exercises or activities to do **before you come to lab** and then
there will be a write-up due after the lab (typically, it will be due on the
Monday morning one week after your lab session).

The instructions for the lab will be posted on the class web site a week before
the lab, and an assignment will be posted on {{< GITHUB >}}.
The **instructions**
explain the lab and tell you how to prepare for it. The **assignment** tells
you what to do and provides an RMarkdown template for your write-up.




## **Basis for Grading**

|                       |       |      |
|:---------------------:|------:|-----:|
| Class participation   |  5%   |      |
| Midterm exam          | 10%   |      |
| Laboratory            | 55%   |      |
| Final Exam            | 30%   |      |


### **Tests and Examinations**

The midterm exam will be a take-home test. You will submit it on 
{{< BRIGHTSPACE >}} and it will be due on
{{< MIDTERM_DATE >}}. 
The midterm will cover your knowledge of the basic science of the 
climate system and climate change.

The final exam will be an open-book take-home essay exam, 
for which you may use your books and notes.
You will submit your take-home final electronically on {{< BRIGHTSPACE >}}.
The final exam is due by the end of the scheduled alternate final exam,
at {{< FINAL_EXAM_DATE_TIME >}}.


The final exam will be cumulative over all the material covered during the term.


# Honor Code:

This course, like all courses at Vanderbilt, is conducted under the Honor Code.

* **Studying:** As you study for this class, I encourage you to to seek help 
  from me{{< IF_TA >}}, from {{% TA_FORMAL_NAME %}}, {{< /IF_TA >}} or from other classmates or friends.

* **Lab Assignments:** I encourage working together, and in most lab assignments
  you will be explicitly told to work with a partner. I also encourage you to
  talk with other classmates, as well as friends and acquaintances outside of
  class. You may discuss assignments, compare notes on how you are working a
  problem, and you may look at your classmates' work on homework assignments.
  But you must work through the problems yourself in the work you turn in:
  **Even if you have discussed the solution with others you must
  work through the steps yourself and express the answers in your own words.
  You may not simply copy someone else's answer.**

* **Tests and Exams:** Tests are different from homework and labs:
  **all work on tests and exams must be entirely your own**.
  **You may not work together with anyone or receive any help from anyone
  but me{{< IF_TA >}} or from {{% TA_FORMAL_NAME %}}{{< /IF_TA >}}
  on exams and tests (this includes the take-home final exam)**.

If you ever have questions about how the Honor Code applies to your work
in this course, please ask me{{< IF_TA >}} or {{% TA_FORMAL_NAME %}}{{< /IF_TA >}}.
**Uncertainty about the Honor Code does not excuse a violation.**

## Research Integrity

Beyond the University Honor Code, this course also emphasizes the scientific
ethical principles of research integrity.
Honesty is a very important part of research integrity, but it is only one part.
Clearly, science cannot work if scientists are not scrupulously honest about
the results of their research and there is no tolerance for scientists who
lie. But research integrity goes much farther. Real science happens in the
context of a scientific community and the integrity of this community is
critical. The ethical principles of research
integrity have grown over the centuries to protect the integrity of the
scientific community. Indeed, the mathematician and poet Jacob Bronowski wrote,
in his book, _Science and Human Values_ (Harper & Row, 1956) that what makes
science work and makes it great is much less about the intellectual brilliance
and skills of individual scientists than about the ethical commitment to truth
and human dignity by the community of scientists.

Science does not proceed only by making leaps of discovery
but also by making useful mistakes and then discovering and correcting the
errors in those mistakes. Because of this, scientific integrity requires
scientists to be extremely transparent and forthcoming about all the details of
their research. It is not enough to sincerely report a discovery or an idea in
good faith, but one must also provide others with the tools to critically
examine that discovery and idea, and if a scientist learns, even many years
later, that a report or discovery contained an error, they must
correct the error and actively inform other scientists about it.

When a scientist discovers an error in their past work and does not promptly
and actively correct it, other scientists may continue to rely on the truth of
that result and thus waste time, effort, and money.
Thus, both making one's own work available to others so they can have the
opportunity to find errors, and also to promptly and publicly report any
errors that one finds in one's own work are two critical pieces of research
integrity.

Another aspect also involves the communal nature of science: None of us works
in isolation, and every scientist's work builds on work by others.
There are two reasons why it is critical to acknowledge the role of others' work
in our own research reports: First, it is important to give others the credit
for their contributions to our shared body of scientific knowledge. Secondly,
it is important for others to know where the data and methods we use come from.
If I use someone else's data or methods for an analysis and it later turns out
that there were problems with their data or methods, then it is important for
people reading my work to be able to examine my work and evaluate how those
errors might affect my own results.

I want to emphasize that these considerations about research integrity are not
just negative things. They are very positive, which is why so many researchers
are embracing them.
**By being transparent and forthcoming, and by encouraging
others to reproduce your research results, you can enhance your reputation**,
both for honesty (you show that you have nothing to hide) and for being a
good citizen of the scientific community by making it easy for other researchers
to learn from your work and build on it to make new discoveries and build
new and more powerful tools for analyzing data.

Where this is relevant to this course on Global Climate Change is in our
practice of reproducible research in the laboratory portion of the course.
Making our work, however humble, fully open and transparent so that others
may examine it, criticize it, or build on it to develop new tools and make
new discoveries is an essential part of research integrity.

In your lab reports it will be important for you to document where the data you
worked with comes from (this will mostly be clearly spelled out in the
assignments) and what methods you used to analyze it. Using the tools of R and
RMarkdown will make it easy to almost automatically include this kind of
transparency in your reports. As you do this throughout this course, you will
learn the best practices adopted by the scientific community and develop habits
of openness, transparency, and reproducibility for any research you do in the
future in any area of society, whether in science, journalism, business, or
other endeavors.

# **Final Note:**

I have made every effort to plan a busy, exciting, and instructive semester.
I may find during the term that I need to revise the syllabus to give more time
to some subjects or to pass more quickly over others rather than covering them
in depth.
Thus, while I will attempt to follow this syllabus as closely as I can,
you should realize that it is subject to change during the semester.
