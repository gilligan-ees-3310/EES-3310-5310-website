## Reading:

### Required for Grad Students (optional for undergrads):

* Handout: [Ren21, _Renewables 2021 Global Status Report_](/files/reading_handouts/GSR2021_Full_Report){target="_blank"}, Ch. 1.

### Notes:

Focus on the text on pp. 5--12. In the latter parts, after p. 12, most of the report is figures. Look carefully at the sections on transportation (16--17), electric power generation (18--19), and international comparisons on pp. 20-23. Read lightly the sections on technoloogies on pp. 24--30. There are short text summaries and figures that illustrate the progress that has been made for different technologies.

Focus on pp. 29--37 and 42--45, and 48-55
