## Notice:

If you have a laptop or tablet that you can bring to class and connect to the internet, I recommend you do so today so you can work along with me in using the online models.

## Reading:

No new reading for today.

### Notes:

As you prepare for class, think about:

* What makes some greenhouse gases more powerful than others?
* What are the important differences between the layer-model approach to calculating temperature and the skin-model on pp. 45--46?
* How does band saturation work? How can you recognize saturation in MODTRAN?
* How do you use MODTRAN to calculate the effect of doubling CO~2~?
* How do you use the full-spectrum model to calculate the effect of doubling CO~2~?
