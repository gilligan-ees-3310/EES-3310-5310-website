## Installing Tools {#installing}

### Installing {{< R_LOGO >}} {#installing-r}

* Download R from [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
  * **Windows:** 
    * Download and install the ["base distribution" of R 4.0.3](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/).
  * **MacOS:**
    * Download and install [R version 4.0.3](https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/)
  * **Linux:**
    * You should be able to install R from your Linux distribution's package manager:
      * `sudo apt-get install r-base r-base-dev` for Debian or Ubuntu
      * `sudo yum install R` or `sudo dnf install git` for Fedora, 
        Red Hat, and related distributions.

### Installing {{<GIT_LOGO>}} {#installing-git}

If you have a Mac or Linux you may already have git installed. Test it by 
opening up a terminal window and typing `which git`. If you get a response
like `/usr/bin/git` then it's installed. If there is no response, then you
need to install git.
  
* **Windows:**
  * Download and install git from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
    * Choose the default options for the installer.
  * Optionally, you might want to also install Tortoise Git, which integrates
    git into the Windows explorer, so you can execute git commands from the 
    context menu when you right-click on files or directories in the explorer.
    You can download Tortoise Git from [https://tortoisegit.org/](https://tortoisegit.org/)
* **MacOS:**
    * If git is not already installed on your computer, you can download and
      install it from [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
* **Linux:**
    * If git is not already installed, you can install it from your 
      distribution's package manager:
      * `sudo apt-get install git` for Debian or Ubuntu
      * `sudo yum install git` or `sudo dnf install git` for Fedora, 
        Red Hat, and related distributions.

#### Introducing Youself to {{< GIT_LOGO >}} {#configuring-git}
              
**_Whichever operating system you're using,_** after you install git you will 
need to introduce yourself to git (you only need to do this once).
It is important for git to knows your name and email address so it can 
keep track of who is editing files when you are working collaboratively and
so it gives you credit for the files you have authored and edited.
  
1. Open a terminal prompt:
   * On Windows, open a "git bash" window (git will give you the option to 
     do this when it finishes installing) or you can do so from the Windows 
     Start menu, under "Git".
   * On MacOS or Linux, open a regular terminal window (on MacOS, you can
     find the terminal in the "applications" with Finder)
2. Type the following at the terminal prompt:

   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email your.name@vanderbilt.edu
   ```
     
   using your real name and email.
       
You only need to introduce yourself to git one time after you install it.
Then it will remember who you are every time you use it.

#### Getting an account on GitHUB {{< GITHUB_LOGO >}} {#github-account}

* Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com "GitHub") and register for a free account
* After you have set up your account, go to 
  [https://education.github.com/students](https://education.github.com/students "GitHub Student Accounts") 
  and register your account for the free extras you can get as a student.
* Send an email to Prof. Gilligan and {{< TA_FORMAL_NAME >}} to let us know 
  your GitHUB account name.
  You can send the email from 
  {{< mailto-prof-and-ta subj="EES 3310/5310 GitHub account" >}}this link{{< /mailto-prof-and-ta >}}



### Installing {{< RSTUDIO_LOGO >}} {#installing-rstudio}

* Go to the download page for the free desktop edition of {{< RSTUDIO >}} at 
  [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download "Download RStudio") and
  download the installer for your operating system. Windows, MacOS, 
  and the Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, and openSUSE editions of
  Linux are all supported.
  
  There are other versions of {{< RSTUDIO >}} (an expensive professional edition and a server edition). You
  want the **free desktop edition**.
  Be sure you get versoin 1.4 (the latest version, as of January 2021).
  Version 1.4 has important new features that previous versions did not have.
* Run the installer. 
* After the installer finishes running, run {{< RSTUDIO >}}.
  * When {{< RSTUDIO >}} starts up, the lower left part of the screen should have
    a window that displays the R version, saying something like this:
      
    ```
    R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie"
    Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
    Platform: x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)

    R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
    You are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions.
    Type 'license()' or 'licence()' for distribution details.

    R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
    Type 'contributors()' for more information and
    'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

    Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
    'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
    Type 'q()' to quit R.
    ```
    The details will be different depending on your operating system, but
    if you see something like this, {{< RSTUDIO >}} correctly found R on your 
    computer.
  * Open the "Tools" menu,   and click on the "Global Options" choice.
    * Go to the "Git/SVN" tab and click "enable version control interface 
      for {{< RSTUDIO >}} projects". If {{< RSTUDIO >}} can find the git program on your
      computer, it will appear in the "git executable" field. If {{< RSTUDIO >}}
      can't find it, you can help it by browsing to the git program.
    * If you have installed {{< LATEX_LOGO >}} on your computer (remember that this is
      optional), click on the SWeave tab, and select "knitr" for weaving
      `.Rnw` files, and choose `pdfLaTeX` for typesetting {{< LATEX_LOGO >}} files into
      PDF.

## Optional Tools: {#optional-tools}
  
### Installing the tinytex package {#installing-latex}

**It is optional to install the `tinytex` package.** 
You will be able to do all the work for the labs without it, but if you do 
install it, it will give you the option to produce nicely formatted PDF 
output from your RMarkdown files (for lab reports, presentations, etc.).

The R `tinytex` package installs a sophisticated typesetting system 
called {{< LATEX >}} on your computer. RMarkdown uses this system to 
generate PDF output.

The `tinytex` package needs to download a lot of files from the internet, 
and it can take 10 minutes or more to do so, even on a fast connection.
So it's a good idea to wait until you can let your computer run for a while,
and until you're connected to a good fast internet connection, preferably
one that doesn't charge you for data.

To install `tinytex`, go to the {{< RSTUDIO >}} console, and
you type the following:
  
```
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

If you want to uninstall `tinytex` later, you can just type this
command at the {{< RSTUDIO >}} console:

```
tinytex::uninstall_tinytex()`
```

### Installing {{< GIT_AHEAD >}} {#installing-gitahead}

**It is optional to install GitAhead.** You will be able to do everything you
need for the lab using regular {{< GIT_LOGO >}} and {{< RSTUDIO >}}, but
you may find it useful to install the {{< GIT_AHEAD >}} software on your 
computer. {{< GIT_AHEAD >}} is a free graphical interface that works with 
{{< GIT >}} and allows you to do almost everything you might want to do
using a simple point-and-click interface.

{{< GIT_AHEAD >}} can also make it easier to understand what {{< GIT >}} is 
doing and when you need to commit files and push your commits to 
{{< GITHUB >}} {{< GITHUB_LOGO >}}.

{{< GIT_AHEAD >}} is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux, and you can 
get it from <https://gitahead.github.io/gitahead.com/>.
