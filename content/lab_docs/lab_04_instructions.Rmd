# Note:

Three things to note:

* Because of a mixup on my part, I inadvertently briefly made the answers 
  available, so to keep things fair for everyone, I have posted my answers for 
  everyone to see.
* Because of the in-class reading days on Feb. 23--24, I did not want to make 
  this lab due during or right before or after those reading days, so it will 
  be due Monday March 1. Lab 5 will also be due Mar 1., so you will have to get 
  them both in by then, but between the answers being available and the extra 
  week for this lab, I hope this will give you a lot more flexibility in getting 
  the assignments done.
* One big piece of this lab is to use RMarkdown to write a report that really 
  integrates text with code and graphics and tables that are generated by 
  RMarkdown. Use the fact that you can easily check your answers to the specific 
  questions to give you some freedom to think about how you want to present your 
  answers. Don't just copy and paste from my answers, but think about how you 
  would use RMarkdown to present your answers in your own way.

# Exercises with lapse rate and clouds.

In this lab, you will learn about a new climate model, RRTM.
RRTM stands for "Rapid Radiative Transfer Model."
This model is a radiative-convective model that uses code
from the radiative-transfer portion of a state-of-the-art global climate model
called the "Community Climate System Model," developed at the National Center
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder CO.

The entire CCSM model runs on giant supercomputers, but this radiative transfer
module can run efficiently on an ordinary computer. In order to speed up the
calculations, RRTM does not calculate the entire longwave spectrum the way
MODTRAN does, but uses a simplified approximation that is much faster when
the big climate models need to run this radiative transfer calculation
roughly 52 quadrillion 
(`r format_md(5.2E15, digits = 1, format = "scientific")`) times in a 
simulation of 100 years of the earth's climate.

An advantage that RRTM has over MODTRAN, is that MODTRAN assumes that the
atmosphere is static (none of the air moves), whereas RRTM allows for
convective heat flow. This makes RRTM more realistic, even though it sacrifices
detail in its treatment of longwave radiation.

We will use RRTM to explore the role of convection in the earth system
and to examine the water-vapor feedback in the presence of convection.

You can run the RRTM model interactively on the web at
<http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/>
and I have also written a script that allows you to run it from R.

To run the model interactively, you can adjust various parameters, such as the
brightness of the sun, the albedo (it gives you a choice of many natural and
human-made surfaces, such as asphalt, concrete, forest, grassland, snow, ocean,
and the average for the earth) the concentrations of CO~2~ and methane,
the relative humidity, and the amount and type of high (cirrus) and
low (stratus) clouds.

You can also introduce aerosols typical of different parts of the earth, such as
cities (with soot, sulfates, and other pollution), deserts (with blowing dust),
oceans (with sea spray and salt), and a Pinatubo-like volcanic eruption.

Like MODTRAN, the RRTM model does not automatically adjust the surface 
temperature.
Instead, it calculates the upward and downward flux of longwave and shortwave
radiation at 51 different levels of the atmosphere and reports whether the heat
flow is balanced (heat in = heat out) at the top of the atmosphere.

If the earth is _gaining_ heat, you can manually _raise_ the surface temperature
until you balance the heat flow, and if the earth is _losing_ heat, you can
manually _lower_ the temperature.

## R Interface to RRTM

I have written an R function `run_rrtm` that allows you to manually run
RRTM from R. To use this function, you need to include the line
`source("_scripts/rrtm.R")` or `source(file.path(script_dir, "rrtm.R"))`
to load it.

* `run_rrtm()` allows you to automatically download a file
  with the data from a MODTRAN run. You call it with the following arguments:

  * `filename` is the name of the file to save the data to. The function
    returns the output data, so it's optional to specify a file name.

  * `co2_ppm` is the amount of CO~2~ in parts per million. The default is 400.

  * `ch4_ppm` is the amount of methane in parts per million. The default is 1.7.

  * `relative_humidity` is the relative humidity, in percent. The default is
    80%.

  * `T_surface` is the surface temperature, in Kelvin.
    The default (for 400 ppm CO~2~, etc.) is 284.42.
    You adjust this to restore radiative equilibrium after you change the
    parameters (amount of CO~2~, lapse rate, etc.).

  * `I_solar` is the brightness of the sun, in Watts per square meter.
    The default value is 1360.

  * `surface_type` is the type of surface (this is used to calculate the
    albedo). The default is `earth average. The options are:

    * "`earth average`": The average albedo of the earth (0.30)
    * "`asphalt`": Dark asphalt (0.08)
    * "`concrete`": Concrete (0.55)
    * "`desert`": Typical desert (0.40)
    * "`forest`": Typical forest (0.15)
    * "`grass`": Typical grassland (0.25)
    * "`ocean`": Ocean (0.10)
    * "`snow`": Typical snow (0.85)
    * "`ice`": Large ice masses covering ocean or land (0.60)
    * "`soil`": Bare soil (0.17)
    * "`custom`": Custom albedo (if you choose this, you need to also supply
      a value for `albedo`)

  * `tropopause_km` is the altitude of the tropopause, in kilometers above
    sea level. The default value is 15, which is typical of middle latitudes.
    The tropopause varies from place to place around the Earth, from around 
    9 km at the poles to around 17 km near the equator.

  * `lapse_rate` is the lapse rate, in Kelvin per kilometer. The default is
    6, which is roughly the global average environmental lapse rate. 
    The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10, so it's physically impossible to
    have an persistent environmental lapse rate greater than 10 and results 
    with `lapse_rate` greater than 10 won't make sense.

  * `low_cloud_frac` is the fraction (from 0.0--1.0) of the sky covered by
    low (stratus) clouds. The default is 0.0.

  * `high_cloud_frac` is the fraction (from 0.0--1.0) of the sky covered by
    high (cirrus) clouds. The default is 0.0.

  * `cloud_drop_radius` is the size of the water droplets in the clouds,
    in microns. The default is 10. (For reference, 10 microns is about the
    size of a red blood cell).
    You can make the droplets smaller to simulate the indirect aerosol effect.

  * `aerosols` allows you to set up the atmosphere with the kinds and
    quantities of aerosols typical of a number of different environments.
    Options are:

      * "`none`": No aerosols
      * "`ocean`": Typical ocean aerosols (sea-spray, salt, etc.)
      * "`desert`": Typical desert aerosols (dust, sand)
      * "`city`": Typical city with soot (black carbon) and sulfate aerosols.
      * "`city just sulfates`": Just sulfate aerosols typical of a city.
      * "`city just soot`": Just soot (black carbon) aerosols typical of a
        city.
      * "`land`": Typical rural land (dust, etc.)
      * "`polluted land`": Typical rural land suffering from pollution
        (e.g., from farming)
      * "`antarctic`": Typical aerosols for Antarctica
      * "`volcano`": Similar sulfate and dust to the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic
        eruption.

  Any arguments you don't specify explicitly take on their default value.
  Thus, `run_rrtm(co2_ppm = 800, relative humidity = 10, T_surface = 300)`
  would run with all the default values, except for 800 ppm CO~2~,
  relative humidity of 10%, and a surface temperature of 300 Kelvin.

  `run_rrtm` returns a list of data containing:

  * Basic parameters of the model run:
    * `T_surface`
    * `co2_ppm`
    * `ch4_ppm`
    * `I_solar`
    * `albedo`
    * `lapse_rate`
    * `tropopause_km`
    * `relative_humidity`
    * `aerosols`,
    * `low_cloud_frac`
    * `high_cloud_frac`
    * `cloud_drop_radius`
  * Results of the model calculations:
    * `Q`: The heat imbalance $I_{\text{in}} - I_{\text{out}}$
    * `i_in`: The net solar radiation absorbed by the earth
      ($(1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} / 4$)
    * `i_out`: The net longwave radiation emitted to space from the top
      of the atmosphere
    * `profile`: A tibble containing a profile of the atmosphere
      (altitude in km, pressure in millibar, and temperature in Kelvin)
    * `fluxes`: A tibble containing the fluxes (in Watts per square
      meter) of longwave, shortwave, and total radiation going up and
      down at 52 levels from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.
      The columns are `altitude` (km), `T` (temperature in K),
      `P` (pressure in millibar), `sw_up` (upward shortwave), `sw_down`
      (downward shortwave), `lw_up` (upward longwave), `lw_down`
      (downward longwave), `total_up` (`sw_up` + `lw_up`), and
      `total_down (`sw_down` + `lw_down`).

There are also functions for reading RRTM data files and plotting RRTM data:

* `read_rrtm(file)` reads an RRTM file saved by `run_rrtm` and returns a
  list of data just like the one returned by `run_rrtm`.

* `plot_heat_flows()`: plots the upward and downward fluxes of radiation from
  an RRTM file or data structure. You can call it either with
  `plot_rrtm(file = "filename")` or `plot_rrtm(data = rrtm_data)`, where
  "`filename`" and "`rrtm_data`" stand for your own file name or RRTM data
  structure returned by `run_rrtm` or `read_rrtm`.

    You can also specify which wavelengths to plot. By default, it plots
    shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and total (SW + LW), but you can specify
    one or more of `sw = FALSE`, `lw = FALSE`, or `total = FALSE` to
    omit wavelengths.

## Example of running RRTM

Here is an example of running RRTM:

```{r rrtm_example}
default_rrtm = run_rrtm()

# Surface temperature:
default_rrtm$T_surface

# Heat imbalance:
default_rrtm$Q
```

This run has surface temperature
`r format_md(default_rrtm$T_surface, digits = 2)` K and a heat imbalance of
`r format_md(default_rrtm$Q, digits = 2)` Watts per square meter.

### Interpreting RRTM Results

We can plot the heat flows as a function of altitude:
```{r plot_rrtm_example}
plot_heat_flows(default_rrtm)
```

What you see in this plot are thick lines representing downward heat flow
and thin lines representing upward flow. The different colors represent
shortwave, longwave, and total (shortwave + longwave).

A few things to notice: At the top of the atmosphere, at
`r format_md(max(default_rrtm$fluxes$altitude), digits = 0)` km,
there is very little longwave going down, but a lot of shortwave going down
(around `r format_md(tail(default_rrtm$fluxes$sw_down, 1), digits = 1)` W/m^2^).
Conversely, there is a modest amount of shortwave going up
(around `r format_md(tail(default_rrtm$fluxes$sw_up, 1), digits = 0)` W/m^2^),
but a lot of longwave going up (around
`r format_md(tail(default_rrtm$fluxes$lw_up, 1), digits = 1)` W/m^2^).

The upward shortwave radiation is sunlight reflected from the atmosphere and
the earth's surface.

The upward longwave radiation is emitted from the surface and the atmosphere.
You can see that the longwave radiation, both up and down, is greater closer to
the surface, where temperatures are warmer, and smaller at higher altitudes,
where the atmosphere is cooler.

If we look at the total radiation, we see that there is a good balance near the
top of the atmosphere (the upward and downward lines come together), but
in the lower atmosphere, there is a serious imbalance with downward fluxes
significantly larger than the upward ones.

This is a consequence of convection: The difference between the downward and
upward radiative fluxes is taken up by convection, which moves heat upward
when warm air rises and cool air sinks.

### Determining Climate Sensitivity with RRTM

We can also use the RRTM model to study what happens when we double CO~2~:
```{r rrtm_warming}
rrtm_double_co2 = run_rrtm(co2_ppm = 800)
```
```{r rrtm_doubled_co2_balanced, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
new_ts = 286.9 # Kelvin
rrtm_double_co2_balanced = run_rrtm(co2_ppm = 800, T_surface = new_ts)
```
When we double CO~2~ without changing the surface temperature
(T~surface~ = `r format_md(rrtm_double_co2$T_surface, digits = 3)` K),
this creates a heat imbalance of `r format_md(rrtm_double_co2$Q, digits = 1)`
W/m^2^. We can use the online interactive version of RRTM to adjust surface
temperature until the heat flows balance. The surface temperature where this
happens is `r format_md(new_ts, digits = 3)` K and we can paste it into our
R code:
```{r rrtm_sensitivity, echo = TRUE, include = TRUE, ref.label="rrtm_doubled_co2_balanced"}
```

When we set T~surface~ to
`r format_md(rrtm_double_co2_balanced$T_surface, digits = 3)` K, the heat
imbalance becomes `r format_md(rrtm_double_co2_balanced$Q, digits = 2)`
Watts/m^2^. The climate sensitivity is the change in equilibrium
T~surface~ when you double CO~2~:
$\Delta T_{2\times \text{CO}_2} = `r format_md(rrtm_double_co2_balanced$T_surface, digits = 3)`~\mathrm{K} -
`r format_md(default_rrtm$T_surface, digits = 3)`~\mathrm{K} =
`r format_md(rrtm_double_co2_balanced$T_surface - default_rrtm$T_surface, digits = 1)`~\mathrm{K}$.
You may remember that in last week's lab, we calculated the climate sensitivity 
with MODTRAN (using constant relative humidity to enable water-vapor feedback) 
and got $\Delta T_{2\times\text{CO}_2} = 1.2$ K for the tropical atmosphere 
(it's smaller for the other atmospheres), so this shows that including 
convection in our calculations roughly doubles the climate sensitivity.

# New R and RMarkdown tricks

Sometimes you may want to use different text into your document, depending
on what the result of a calculation is.

For instance, I might have a function called `foo` that returns a number
and I want to write something different if `foo(x)` > x than if
`foo(x)` < x. Here, the function `ifelse` can come in handy.
```{r define_foo}
foo = function(x) {
  x^2
}
```
Now I can write `ifelse(foo(x) < x, "less than", "greater than")`. 
The following RMarkdown text:
```
When x = 0.5, `foo(x)` is
``r 'r'` x = 0.5; ifelse(foo(x) < x, "less than", "greater than")` x,
but when x = 2.0, `foo(x)` is
``r 'r'` x = 2.0; ifelse(foo(x) < x, "less than", "greater than")` x.
```
becomes 

> When x = 0.5, `foo(x)` is
> `r x = 0.5; ifelse(foo(x) < x, "less than", "greater than")` x,
> but when x = 2.0, `foo(x)` is
> `r x = 2.0; ifelse(foo(x) < x, "less than", "greater than")` x.

You may have spotted a problem with the code above: What if `foo(x)` = x?
Then I need another `ifelse`:
`ifelse(foo(x) < x, "less than", ifelse(foo(x) > x, "greater than", "equal to"))`.
This is cumbersome to type into your text, so you might want to write a function:
```{r compare_foo}
compare_f = function(f, x) {
  # f is a function
  # x is a number or a numeric variable
  result = f(x)
  ifelse(result < x, "less than",
         ifelse(result > x, "greater than",
                "equal to"))
}
```
Now I can just write `compare_f(foo, x)`:
The following RMarkdown text:
``` r
When x = 0.5, `foo(x)` is ``r 'r'` compare_f(foo, 0.5)` x, but
when x = 2.0, `foo(x)` is ``r 'r'` compare_f(foo, 2.0)` x, and
when x = 1.0, `foo(x)` is ``r 'r'` compare_f(foo, 1.0)` x.
```
becomes 

> When x = 0.5, `foo(x)` is `r compare_f(foo, 0.5)` x, but
> when x = 2.0, `foo(x)` is `r compare_f(foo, 2.0)` x, and
> when x = 1.0, `foo(x)` is `r compare_f(foo, 1.0)` x.

This may seem kind of strange, but a lot of people and organizations use
RMarkdown to prepare reports regularly using different data.
For instance, many businesses use RMarkdown to generate monthly reports
on sales, finances, etc., and using code like the `compare` function I
showed here can help to automate the reports, so that when they run the 
report each month using different data, the text will adjust automatically to 
reflect the new numbers.

It is also applicable to climate science, where many laboratories like to
update their reports every month or every year with the latest climate data.

# Exercises

These are the exercises you will work for the lab this week.

## General Instructions

In the past three weeks, we focused on mastering many of the basics of using
R and RMarkdown. For this week's lab, when you write up the answers, I would
like you to think about integrating your R code chunks with your text.

For instance, you can describe what you're going to do to answer the question,
and then for each step, after you describe what you're going to do in that
step, you can include an R code chunk to do what you just described, and then
the subsequent text can either discuss the results of what you just did
or describe what the next step of the analysis will do.

This way, your answer can have several small chunks of R code that build on
each other and follow the flow of your text.

For this lab, you will use the RRTM model, which includes both radiation and
convection.

### Exercise 1: Lapse Rate

Run the RRTM model in its default configuration and then vary the lapse rate
from 0 to 10 K/km. For each value of the lapse rate, adjust the surface
temperature until the earth loses as much heat as it gains (i.e., the value of
_Q_ in the `run_rrtm` model output is zero.)

It will probably be easier to do this with the interactive version of the RRTM
model at <http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/> than with the R interface
`run_rrtm`.

a) Make a tibble containing the values of the lapse rate and the corresponding
   equilibrium surface temperature, and then (in your report):
   * Make a table showing lapse rate and temperature.
   * Make a plot with lapse rate on the horizontal axis and surface temperature 
     on the vertical axis.

b) Describe how the equilibrium surface temperature varies as the lapse rate
   varies.

## Exercises on Albedo and Clouds

For the following exercises, start off with the RRTM model in its default 
configuration. 
Record the ground temperature.
For each part of this exercise you will do the following:

1. You will adjust the albedo or the clouds.
2. You will compare the visible and longwave radiation going down through the 
   atmosphere to the surface and also the visible and longwave radiation 
   going up from the surface, through the atmosphere, to space.
   
   The results of an RRTM model run have a tibble called `fluxes` with columns
   for `altitude`, `sw_down`, `sw_up`, `lw_down`, `lw_up`, `total_down`, and
   `total_up`, where `sw` means shortwave, `lw` means longwave, and `total`
   is the sum of shortwave plus longwave.
   
   The first row of this tibble is at ground-level and the last row
   is at the top of the atmosphere.
   
   ``` r 
   default_data = run_rrtm()
   fluxes = default_data$fluxes
   surface_fluxes = head(fluxes, 1) # get the first row
   space_fluxes = tail(fluxes, 1)   # get the last row
   ```
   
3. You will adjust the ground temperature until the heat coming in balances
   the heat going out (the model will say, 
   "If the Earth has these properties ... then it loses as much energy as it
   gains."

### Exercise 2: The urban heat island

First, run the RRTM model in its default configuration and note the surface
temperature and the albedo.

```{r RRTM_default}
default = run_rrtm()
albedo_default = default$albedo
T_surface_default = default$T_surface
```

a) Change the surface type from "Earth's average" to "Asphalt" (don't change
   the surface temperature until the instructions tell you to) and describe
   the changes in the local climate:
   * What is the albedo?
   * Report the changes in shortwave and longwave light absorbed by 
     the surface and going out to space.
   * How much does the total balance of heat change (i.e., how many W/m^2^ does
     the Earth lose or gain)?
   * Now, adjust the ground temperature until the Earth loses as much energy as 
     it gains. 
   * What is the new surface temperature? 
     How does it compare to the surface temperature in the default 
     configuration?

b) Change the surface albedo to "Concrete". Answer the same questions as in part
   (a).
   
c) In cities, streets and parking lots are usually paved with asphalt.
   Roofs of houses and other buildings are often covered with asphalt shingles 
   or black rubber-like compounds. 

   The results you got in this exercise represent covering _the entire planet_
   with asphalt or concrete, so they are far more extreme than you would get
   from only covering _part of a city_ with one material or the other, but 
   the general principle holds and in a city you would have much smaller 
   changes, but they would be in the same direction as you found here.

   How would the choice of using asphalt for roads, parking lots, and roofs in
   a large city affect the local climate in the city?
   Would using low-albedo materials, such as concrete for streets and parking 
   lots and light-colored polymers for the roofs of buildings have a benefit 
   for the people living in the city?

### Exercise 3: Clouds

First, run the RRTM model in its default configuration and note the surface
temperature and the albedo.

a) Change the low cloud fraction to 0.70 (70%)
   * Report the changes in shortwave and longwave light absorbed by the 
     surface and going out to space.
   * How much does the total balance of heat change 
     (i.e., how many W/m^2^ does the Earth lose or gain)?
   * Adjust the temperature to bring the heat flows back into balance.
   * How much did the temperature change?

b) Repeat part (a), but with the low cloud fraction set to 0 and the high-cloud
   fraction set to 0.20 (20%).
   
c) Use the `plot_heat_flows()` function to plot the heat flows for the 
   low clouds and the high clouds. Describe the changes you see in the upward 
   and downward heat flows (shortwave, longwave, and total) for the two cases.
   Which kind of cloud had the biggest effect on the outgoing radiation?
