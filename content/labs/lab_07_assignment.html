<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>Everyone is feeling a lot of stress and fatigue at this point in the semester, so I have decided to give everyone a week off from new lab assignments.</p>
<p>Starting next week, you will start an independent lab project where you will spend a couple of weeks developing an independent project to look at a new question about climate science. This question can involve looking more deeply into something that you studied in a previous lab, or it can be something new.</p>
<p>For this week, your assignment is to propose an independent project. <strong>Your proposal will be due Friday March 12 by the end of the day, on Brightspace.</strong> The proposal only needs to be a couple of paragraphs describing what you want to study and what kinds of data (model output, or archived climate data that you will download from the internet).</p>
<p>Lab on Monday March 8 will be used to discuss possible project topics and Mr.Â de Wet and I will be available to give you feedback and help you think about where you will get data to carry out the project.</p>
