# Overview:

This lab will explore the role of convection (the vertical motion of air) in the 
atmosphere, clouds, and their effects on climate.

Something too note:
  
* One big piece of this lab is to use RMarkdown to write a report that really 
  integrates text with code and graphics and tables that are generated by 
  RMarkdown. Use the fact that you can easily check your answers to the specific 
  questions to give you some freedom to think about how you want to present your 
  answers. Don't just copy and paste from my answers, but think about how you 
  would use RMarkdown to present your answers in your own way.
