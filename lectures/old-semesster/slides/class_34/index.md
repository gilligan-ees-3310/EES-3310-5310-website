# The Big Picture: { .center data-transition="fade-out" data-state="skip_slide"}

## Two perspectives on worldwide decarbonization:<br/>50% below 1990 by 2050 {#two-perspectives}

::::::::: {.columns}
:::::: {.column .bordered}
::: {.center-text}
**Pielke**
:::

* Cutting emissions to 10,800 MMT by 2050 would mean building 
  * 4.4 nuclear power plants per week for 40 years
  * Or 1000 solar plants per week
  * Or 4000 wind turbines per week 
* {+1} This sounds impossible
::::::
:::::: {.column  .bordered .fragment data-fragment-index="2"}
::: {.center-text}
**Alternate**
:::

* Meeting growing energy demand with fossil fuels would mean building
  * 3 coal-fired plants per week
  * Or 3 nuclear plants per week
* {+3} If demand for coal grows at almost 2% per year, what happens to price?
::::::
:::::::::

[**Conclusion:** Providing energy will be a big challenge whether we use clean 
energy or fossil fuels.]{.fragment data=fragment-index="4"}

### End-Use Power (Trillion Watts) {#end-use-power}

| | **2010** | **2030** |
|:----|----:|----:|
| US  | 2.5 | 2.8 |
| World | 12.5 | 16.9 |

<span style="font-size:80%;">**Note:** 1 TW = 90 quads/year</span>

* **Goal:**
  * All _new_ energy from Wind, Water, Sun by 2030
    * US: 0.3 TW
    * World: 4.5 TW
  * _All energy_ from WWS by 2050
  *  Cost: \$100 trillion over 40 years<br/>(vs. \$10 trillion for fossil)

### <span class="fragment">**Energy Requirements in 2030:**</span>

* {+} 16.9 TW conventional energy
* {+} 11.5 TW with efficiency/reliability gains

## Actual Hydroelectric Output (2006--2016) {#historical-hydro}

![Today's hydroelectric capacity](assets/images/actual_hydro.png){style="height:750px;"}

## Hydroelectricity {#hydro-summary .ninety}

* {+} Jacobson claims 1,300 GW peak hydroelectrricity
* {+} Today's capacity is ~88 GW
* {+} Jacobson assumes 1500% increase in generating capacity for existing dams:
  * Install 15 times more turbines in existing dams
  * {+} Peak water discharge from many dams >5 &times; greatest historical 
    floods:
    * Flooding
    * Disruption of ecosystems (fish, etc.)
    * Disruption of agricultural/irrigation use
* {+} New turbines, retrofitting dams not included in cost estimates

## Energy Storage: Underground Thermal {#utes}

* Assumes massive increase in underground thermal energy storage (UTES)
* Massive infrastructure (pipes, pumping)
* Possible, but very expensive, not included in cost estimates 
  * Could add $1.8 trillion

## Hydrogen {#hydrogen}

* Jacobson assumes 100,000 times more hydrogen production than today's world
  capacity.
* Assumes hydrogen-powered airplanes by 2035

## Modeling Climate and Energy {#modeling-issues .ninety}

* {+} Jacobson's analysis rests on models written by Jacobson's team
  * {+} Many other climate models are open source, available to other scientists
  * {+} Jacobson's are closed source
  * {+} Other models participate in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project to 
    compare accuracy, identify strengths & weaknesses
  * {+} Jacobson's models have not participated
* {+} Novel electrical supply/demand matching model LOADMATCH has not been made
  public or tested independently.
  
# Big Picture {#big-picture-sec .center data-state="skip_slide"}

## Big picture {#big-picture .eighty}

* Big disagreement about small differences.
  * Jacobson's critics believe it's practical to get 74--84% of electricity 
    from clean energy sources:
    * 58--68% from renewables
    * 16% from nuclear
    * 16--26% from natural gas
  * Jacobson insists 100% wind, water, solar, and believes nuclear is
    a very bad idea
* {+} Even if Jacobson is correct, his cost estimate is $100 trillion over
  20--40 years ($2.5--5 trillion per year: 3.2--6.5% of global GDP).
  * Is there political will to spend this much?
  * Jacobson claims renewable energy will repay investment in fuel savings

# Subsequent Developments {#lawsuit-sec .center}

## Jacobson Sues Critics, Journal {#lawsuit}

* {+} **Sept 2017:** Jacobson filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against his 
  critics and the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences for 
  publishing their criticisms of his work.
  * {+} Claimed critics and journal "knowingly and intentionally published false 
    statements of fact."
  * {+} Insisted his critics were corrupt and were in the pay of the fossil fuel 
    and nuclear power industries.
* {+} **Feb 2018:** Jacobson dropped the lawsuit
