# Questions from Reading? {id="questions" .center}


# Important Concepts: {.center}

## Important Concepts:


* What kinds of things can cause the global temperature to change?
  * {+} Energy Balance:
    * Temperature is steady when \(\text{Heat}_{\text{in}} = \text{Heat}_{\text{out}}\).
  * {+} What happens when \(\text{Heat}_{\text{in}} > \text{Heat}_{\text{out}}\)?
  * {+} What kinds of things can cause \(\text{Heat}_{\text{in}}\) to change?
  * {+} What kinds of things can cause \(\text{Heat}_{\text{out}}\) to change?


## Temperature Change 

* How much has earth warmed in the last century or so?
  * {+} About 1.0&deg;C (1.8&deg;F)
* {+} If CO~2~ emissions keep rising on their current path, how much do 
  scientists expect it to warm in the next century?
  * {+} Somewhere around 3--6&deg;C (5--11&deg;F)
* {+} What is the seasonal temperature change in Nashville (winter to summer)?
  * {+} Around 23&deg;C (42&deg;F) 47&deg;F in January, 89&deg;F in August.
* {+} What is the average daily temperature range in Nashville (night to day)?
  * {+} Around 11&deg;C (20&deg;F)

> *  **So why do people worry about global warming?**



## Predictions

> * Meteorologists can't predict whether it will rain three weeks from today
>   with any confidence.
> * So how can I trust predictions about the climate 100 years 
>   from now?

## Economics, Policy, Climate

:::::: {.columns .vcenter}
::: {.column width="59%"}
* Why don't markets manage greenhouse gas emissions well?
  * {+1} Pollution is an **externality**
* {+2} How does Nordhaus propose to fix this problem?
  * {+3} Ronald H. Coase (1920--2013): 
    * {+4} Solve externality problems by assigning property rights
      * {+5} Cap-and-trade: Permits
      * {+5} Emissions tax: Put price on emissions

## Economics and Vulnerability

> *  For an economist, what are the big dangers associated with climate change?
>     -  **Managed** vs. **unmanaged**, **unmanageable** resources

::: {.fragment}
### Breakout Room Discussion (5 minutes) {style="margin-top:3em;"}

* Can you think of examples of **managed**, **unmanaged**, and **unmanageable**
  resources?
* How would you respond to climate change differently for the 3 kinds of 
  resources?

# Tipping Points {.center}

## Tipping Points

* Consider a wooden stick
* {+} Bend it a little
  * {+} When you let it go, it springs back to its original shape
* {+} Bend it too far
  * {+} It snaps
  * {+} When you let it go, it does not return to its original shape

## Amplification of Climate Change

![Albedo of ice versus ocean water](assets/images/ice_albedo.png){style="height:900px;"}

## Climate Tipping Points

* {+} Unknown, uncertain, but dangerous
* {+} We may have crossed a tipping point in sea-level rise
  * West Antarctic ice sheet may be past saving
* {+} Less likely:
  * {+} Runaway warming
    * Temperature rises
    * Biomass in Arctic tundra thaws and decays
    * Releases methane & CO~2~
    * Further warming
* {+} Climate tipping points:
  * {+} We don't know if they exist
  * {+} We don't know where they are
  * {+} How do we make policy for those risks?
