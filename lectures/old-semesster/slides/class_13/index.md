# Mineral Weathering {#weathering-sec .center}




## Carbonate vs. Silicate Weathering {#carbonate-silicate-comparison .eighty}

* {+} **Carbonate Weathering:**
  * {+} Dissolves carbonate minerals on land
  * {+} Increases ocean carbonate
    * {+} Adds _twice as much carbonate_ to oceans as silicate weathering
    * {+} Relieves ocean acidification
    * {+} Increases transfer of CO~2~ from atmosphere to ocean
    * {+} Creates carbonate rocks on sea floor 
      with carbon that originated on land
  * {+} Does not transform atmospheric CO~2~ to rocks
* {+} **Silicate Weathering:**
  * {+} Transforms carbon dioxide in atmosphere into rocks
    * Creates carbonate rocks on sea floor<br/>with 
      carbon that originated in atmosphere

## Weathering as Thermostat  {#thermostat-2-1 .eightyfive}

CO~2~ concentration is controlled by the balance of
<br/>volcanic outgassing and chemical weathering

::: {.mtop-3}
* {+} **Higher temperatures:**
  * More rain, faster chemical reactions
  * Faster weathering
  * Atmospheric \(\COO\) falls
* {+} **Lower temperatures**
  * Less rain, slower chemical reactions
  * Slower weathering
  * Atmospheric \(\COO\) rises
:::

## Temperature of Earth {#temperature-recap}

::: {.mtop-3}
* Weathering acts as thermostat.
* {+} Earth's temperature has been remarkably stable over time.
  * {+} 4 billion years ago, sun was 30% dimmer...
  * {+} With today's greenhouse effect the earth would have been frozen
  * {+} But there has constantly been liquid water.
  * {+} Early earth had more greenhouse gases (thermostat)
* {+} Geologic change alters thermostat "setting":
  * {+} Volcanic outgassing
  * {+} Land surface (e.g., mountain ranges)
  * {+} Vascular plants
* {+} In the long run, silicate thermostat will fix global warming...
  * {+} ...but it will take tens to hundreds of thousands of years.
:::

## Prospects for future: {#future-prospects}

* {+} **Oceanic sinks:**
  * {+} A few centuries:
    * Around 50% of excess \(\COO\) dissolves into oceans
    * {+} Dissolution stops as oceans acidify
  * {+} A few thousand years:
    * Reactions with limestone restore \(\pH\), \(\COO\) solubility
  * {+} Hundreds of thousand of years
    * Silicate-mineral weathering removes and buries excess \(\COO\).
* {+} **Bottom line:**
  * CO~2~ stays in the atmosphere many thousands of years after we stop
    burning fossil fuels.

# {#co2-lifetime-plot data-background-color="white" data-background="assets/images/ar10f03.png" data-background-size="contain"}

# CO~2~ vs. Methane {#methane.lifetime}

* \(\COO\):
  * After 1000 years, around 30%
    of excess \(\COO\) remains in atmosphere
  * After 10,000 years, 13% remains
  * After 100,000 years, 6% remains
* {+} Methane (\(\methane\)):
  * 31 times more powerful (molecule-for-molecule) than \(\COO\)
  * {+} Atmospheric lifetime: 12.4 years:
    * {+} After 25 years, 13% remains.
    * {+} After 100 years, 0.031% remains.

## Temperature Anomaly   {#anomaly_def .ninety data-transition="fade-out"}

* {+} **Global temperature change:**
  * {+} Average temperatures are different at different places.
  * {+} Temperatures change with the seasons
  * {+} How to compare temperature change between places with different climates?
* {+} **Temperature anomaly:**
  * {+} Define a reference time period (several decades)
  * {+} Anomaly =

  *  Anomaly = \({\color{darkblue}7.2^\circ\mathrm{C}} - {\color{darkgreen}3.0^\circ\mathrm{C}} = 4.3^\circ\mathrm{C}\)

* More sunspots \(\rightarrow\) brighter
* 11 year cycle
