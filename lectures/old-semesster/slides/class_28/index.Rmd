# Connecting the Pieces {#connecting-sec .center}

## Connecting the Pieces {#connecting-pieces .center}

1. Targets for emissions & temperature
2. Connecting new policies to previous international agreements & treaties
3. International coordination & enforcement
4. National policy enforcement
5. Innovation, invention, deployment of low-carbon energy

## Temperature Limits {#temp-limits}

* Why does so much policy discussion focus on a 2&deg;C target?
  * Where does 2&deg;C come from?
    * 2&deg;C above what?
  * Is there something special about 2&deg;C?

# History of Climate Agreements {#climate-agreement-sec .center}

## Political Timeline {#political-timeline .eightyfive}

* {+} 1979: World Climate Conference
* {+} 1988: UN Resolution 43/53:
    
   _Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind_
      
  * {+} IPCC established by WMO, UNEP
    * Review research; report on climate change science
* {+} 1992: UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
  * Prevent "_dangerous_" interference with climate
  * Details left for future treaties
* {+} 1997: Kyoto Protocol: Implements UNFCCC
* {+} 2009: Copenhagen Accord
* {+} 2015: Paris Accord

## International Policy {#international-policy .eightyfive}

* UNFCCC (1992):
  * {+} Stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations to prevent "_dangerous_" 
    interference with climate
  * {+} "Lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for
    postponing such measures"
  * {+} How do you define _dangerous_?
    * {+} _Dangerous_ compared to what?
    * {+} Who should choose the definition?
    * {+} Does this put scientists in the position of making
      value judgments for everyone else?

## Kyoto Protocol (1997--2012) {#kyoto .eightyfive}

* Emissions cuts:
  * {+} "Common but differentiated responsibilities"
  * {+} Industrialized nations ("Annex 1")
    * Cut greenhouse gas emissions 5% or more below 1990 levels by 2008.
  * {+} Transition nations (Former Soviet/Warsaw Pact):
    * Given more time to act
  * {+} Developing nations ("Non-Annex")
    * China, India, much of Africa, etc.
    * No obligations
  * {+} Clean Development Mechanism
    * Incentive for developed nations to help less-developed nations
      to adopt clean energy, sustainable practices.

## Copenhagen Accord (2009) {#copenhagen}

* No consensus on binding action
* {+} Informal agreement to limit warming to 2&deg; C
  * Encouraged non-binding national pledges to limit emissions
  * Brought attention to deforestation
  * Pledged $30 billion over 3 years, rising to $100 billion per year
    by 2020 from developed nations to support
    action by developing nations

## Paris Accord (2015) {#paris}

* Pledge to keep warming below 2&deg; C, with aspiration to keep it below
  1.5&deg; C
* {+} Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to reduce emissions
  * {+} Voluntary and non-binding; no enforcement mechanism.
  * {+} 2021 UN Report finds that NDCs are "nowhere close to the level of 
    ambition needed to ... meet the goals of the Paris Agreement."
* {+} "Stocktaking" in 2023 and every 5 years thereafter to assess progress and 
  adjust national commitments.

# Analysis {#analysis-sec .center}

## Pielke on IPCC and Policy {#pielke-policy}

* {+} Detection vs. Attribution of Climate Change
  * Detection: "_Is climate changing_?"
  * Attribution: "_**Why** is climate changing_?"
* {+} IPCC has concluded that
  * Climate is changing (>99% certainty)
    * Last 30 years are the warmest in at least 1400 years (>66% certainty)
  * Human actions are causing most of the climate change observed in the last 
    50 years (>95% certainty)

## Pielke on IPCC and Policy {#pielke-policy-2}

* CO~2~ as control-knob metaphor
  * Pielke: Too much emphasis on CO~2~
  * Others: CO~2~ is unique: magnitude and duration
    * See, Richard Alley, "The Biggest Control Knob:
      Carbon Dioxide in Earth's Climate History" (Dec. 2009)
      
      <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RffPSrRpq_g>
          
## Pielke on IPCC and Policy {#pielke-policy-3}

* Adaptation vs. Mitigation:
  * {+} Bias against adaptation
    * {+} Adaptation is necessary: "committed" warming
    * {+} Limits to adaptation:
      * Deadly heat waves
      * Disruption of ecosystem services
      * Catastrophic sea-level rise
    * {+} Less mitigation &rarr; more expensive adaptation
    * {+} Find the best balance

# Economics and the<br/>Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-sec .center}

## Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost}

* {+} Cost of doing nothing (different scenarios)
* {+} Convert to cost-per-tonne of emissions
* {+} Some people report the cost per tonne of carbon atoms and
      <br/>others report the cost per tonne of CO~2~ molecules

. . .
  
### **Note:** {style="text-align:left;margin-top:50px;"}
  
* tonne = metric ton = 2200 points = 1.1 English tons
* GT = gigatonne = billion tonnes
* 1 tonne C = 3.7 tonne CO~2~

## Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-2 .center}

### Example: {style="text-align:left;margin-top:25px;"}

* {+} Emit 5500 GT CO~2~ between now and 2100<br/>
  (5500 GT CO~2~ = 1500 GT C)
* {+} Half stays in atmosphere, doubles CO~2~ concentration
* {+} Suppose climate change reduces world GDP by<br/>$2 trillion per year
  for 100 years

::: {.fragment .eighty .mtop-3}

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\$2~\text{trillion}/\text{year} \times 100~\text{years}}{5500~\text{GT}~\ce{CO2}}
&= \frac{\$200~\text{trillion}}{5.5~\text{trillion tonnes}~\ce{CO2} } \\
&= $36~\text{per tonne}~\ce{CO2} \\
&= $135~\text{per tonne}~\ce{C} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-3}

* 1 gallon gasoline
  * 20 pounds CO~2~ = 0.009 tonne CO~2~
* $1 per tonne CO~2~ = $0.009 per gallon
  * Roughly 1 cent per gallon
* A social cost of $36 per tonne CO~2~ means gasoline costs society
  roughly $0.36 per gallon

## Social Cost of Carbon {#social-cost-4 .eighty}

* Social cost rises with CO~2~ concentration
  * Small warming has very low social cost per tonne
  * Larger warming has high social cost per tonne
* {+} Stern Report (2007)
  * $85 per tonne CO~2~ under BAU ($0.77/gallon gas)
  * $30 per tonne if we stabilize at 550 ppm ($0.27/gallon)
  * $25 per tonne if we stabilize at 450 ppm ($0.22/gallon)
* {+} Low concentrations of CO~2~ = low social cost per tonne
  * but high cost of emissions reduction
  * Hard to justify
* {+} Find best balance between social cost of warming versus 
  cost of reducing emissions
* {+} Cost of reducing emissions drops over time
  * Innovation, new technology

## Why social cost is useful {#social-cost-useful-2 data-transition="fade"}

![Social cost of carbon vs. cost of abatement today](assets/images/cost_benefit_mitigation_1.png){height=750}

## Why social cost is useful {#social-cost-useful-3 data-transition="fade-in"}

![Social cost of carbon vs. cost of abatement later](assets/images/cost_benefit_mitigation_2.png){height=750}

## Implications {#implications}

* Optimum policy would begin with a low price on carbon today
    * Small emissions reductions in near-term
* {+} Over time:
    * Cost of reducing emissions drops
    * Rising CO~2~ concentration raises price of carbon
    * Emissions reductions become more aggressive
* {+} But tipping points could change everything!
