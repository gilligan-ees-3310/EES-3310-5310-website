# Regulation {.center}

## Regulation {.ninety}

* **Command and Control**
* **Market-Based Regulation**
  * Put a price on externalities
  * {+} Let the market decide best balance between costs and benefits of pollution
  * {+} _Pigovian tax_:
    * Tax equal to social cost
      * {+} Directly compensate people hurt by pollution
      * {+} Or rebate other taxes: indirect compensation
      * {+} Or invest in socially beneficial projects
        * Clean energy
        * Infrastructure to adapt to climate change
        * Compensate out-of-work coal miners

## Nordhaus on Pigovian Taxes

* {+} Taxes on something makes people do less of it
* {+} We want people to work, don't want them to pollute
* {+} But we tax working and don't tax polluting
* {+} Revenue-neutral carbon tax:
  * Raise tax on CO~2~, cut payroll taxes

## Details

* {+} People don't like paying taxes
* {+} _Invisible taxes_
  * {+} Charge tax when fossil fuels are extracted from ground or imported
  * {+} Fossil fuel producer pays tax, passes cost on to consumers
* {+} Taxes &rarr; higher prices &rarr; less consumption
* {+} Higher fuel prices:
  * {+} Incentive to buy energy-efficient products
  * {+} Incentive to invent, produce, market efficient products
  * {+} Clean energy becomes more competitive

## Simplicity of Carbon Prices

* **Command and Control**:
  * Government has to assess emissions & costs for all kinds of technology
* {+} **Green consumers**:
  * To reduce carbon footprint, research and calculate emissions embedded
    in products & services
* {+} **Pricing carbon**:
  * Simple calculation: tax carbon content of fuels
  * Consumers receive simple price signal:
    * Shop for lowest price to reduce carbon footprint

## Difficulties

* Setting the correct tax rate is hard
  * {+} Social cost of carbon is uncertain
  * {+} Social cost depends on total emissions now & in the future
    * Set tax to marginal cost based on total emissions to date
    * Tax rises over time

## Difficulties

* {+} People are not always rational consumers
  * Both as individuals and as organizations
* {+} Often don't notice small changes in price
* {+} Often don't recognize opportunities to save through efficiency & conservation
* {+} Importance of calling people's attention to places they could cut emissions
  and save money

## Difficulties

* _Offshoring_
  * If US sets carbon tax, India does not, companies will shift production
    from US to India
  * Big problem unless carbon tax is applied to all countries

## Difficulties

* Lack of control:
  * Actual emissions depend on both _price_ **and** _consumer demand_
    * If regulators underestimate demand, emissions and warming will be 
      greater than goal
    * But if social cost is correct, this may mean benefits of energy
      consumption exceed damage from warming

:::
:::{.mtop-1}
* Tax starts in 2015 at $25 per ton
  * {+} Rise steadily so emissions stabilize at 2000 levels by 2030
  * {+} Carbon tax can be used to reduce deficit or cut other taxes
* {+} However, this tax seems very inadequate to limit warming to 2&deg;C.
  * {+} The longer we wait, the higher the tax must be to achieve a policy goal.
