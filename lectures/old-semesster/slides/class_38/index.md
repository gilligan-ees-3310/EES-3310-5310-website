# Challenges of Decarbonization {#challenges .center}

## Challenges of Decarbonization {#challenges-outline}

* How hard will it be to reduce CO~2~ emissions?
  * {+} Nordhaus:
    * What technology can replace fossil fuels?
    * What policies can stimulate innovation, investment, production, purchase of clean technology?
  * {+} Pielke:
    * The biggest challenge is cost: $RE < C$
    * Make clean technology cheaper than fossil fuels and the problem is solved.

## Perspective: US CO~2~ Emissions {#us-emissions .ninety}

## Rate of Decarbonization {#decarbonization-rate .ninety}

![](assets/fig/us_decarbonization-1.png)

::: {.eighty}

* {+} 2009 policy goal: US emissions 83% less than 2005 by 2050
* {+} _ef_ must drop by 6.2% per year
* {+} Actual rate has been about 2.3% per 
>   year

# Pielke's Views {#pielke .center}

## Tax on death? {#death-tax}

* What do you think of Pielke's argument?

* {+} Trend in _e_ (1980--present): -0.9% per year.
* {+} Trend in _f_ (1970--2000): -0.5% per year.
  * {+} Trend reversed in 2000, but rapid decrease since around 2008.
* {+} So far: Decarbonization driven much more by efficiency than clean energy.
* {+} Rebound: greater efficiency &rarr; more consumption.

::::::

* {+} 1.1 billion people (17% of planet) lack access to electricity
* {+} Over 3 billion (38%) lack clean cooking facilities
* {+} In many nations in Africa and Asia 80--95% of the population is energy-poor.

Students walk for miles to read and study by the lights at the airport parking lot in Conakry Guinea.

* Price has dropped from $80/Watt in 1976 to $0.22/Watt in 2019.
* Dropped 99.7% (a factor of 360) in 43 years

## Innovation Policy {#innovation-policy .eighty}

::::::::::::{.columns}
:::::::::{.column}
* {+1} Knowing price of CO~2~ will rise provides incentive to invest in R&D
* {+2} Valley of Death:
  * {+3} Technology looks promising in laboratory
  * {+4} Potential for big profits
  * {+5} Many years, lots of money to turn laboratory device into product
    * {+6} Product development might fail
    * {+7} Product might not sell
    * {+8} Competitors might copy product
    * {+9} Valley of death
  * {+10} Double externality
    1. Inventors don't get all the value of their inventions
    2. Polluters don't pay the costs of pollution
  * {+11} Government support to cross valley of death

# Pielke's Policy Proposal {#pielke-policy-sec .center}

## Pielke's Policy Proposal: {#pielke-proposal}

* {+} Competition within government
* {+} Public-works model
* {+} Demonstration projects
* {+} Government as consumer of energy innovations
  * Federal government is the largest consumer of energy in the U.S.
    * 350,000 buildings
    * 600,000 vehicles
* {+} $5/ton carbon tax ($0.04 per gallon gas)
  * invest in clean-energy R&D
* {+} Monitor progress
* {+} Develop "plan B" (geoengineering)


## Obliquity {#obliquity .center}

* Appeal to people who don't care about climate change
  * Cheaper energy
  * Reduce pollution (smog, etc.)
  * Reduce dependence on foreign oil
