# The Scientific Consensus on Climate Change {#consensus-sec .center}

## Meaning of Consensus

* {+} Does scientific consensus mean we can be<br/>100% certain that people are warming the planet?
* {+} What about the future impacts of climate change?

# What Gets in the Way of Policy?  {#policy-obs-sec data-transition="fade" data-state="skip_slide"}

## What Gets in the Way of Policy?  {#policy-obs data-transition="fade"}

* {+} Politicians don't understand science?
* {+} Public doesn't understand science?
* {+} Scientists don't understand politics?

## Issues for Policy  {#policy-obs-3}

* What do scientists agree on?
* {+} Should policy focus on limits to CO~2~ or \(\Delta T\)?
* {+} Should policy wait for better scientific certainty?
* {+} Uncertainty:
  * {+} How much warming is "dangerous"?
  * {+} How much CO~2~ would produce dangerous warming?
  * {+} Are there tipping points?
  * {+} If so, where are they?
* {+} Addressing uncertainty:
  * {+} Precautionary principle
    * _Better safe than sorry_
  * {+} No regrets policy
    * _Worth doing even if global warming turns out to be not so bad._

### **Carbon Dioxide and Climate:<br/>A Scientific Assessment**

::: {.ninety .textleft style="box-shadow:none;width:90%;margin:20px;font-size:90%;"}
The conclusions of this brief but intense investigation may be comforting to 
scientists but disturbing to policymakers. If carbon dioxide continues to 
increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will 
result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible. ...

# Fallacies about Climate Change {#fallacies-sec .center}

## Science vs. Values

* {+} Science can tell us:
  * {+} Is the earth warming?
  * {+} Why is the earth warming?
  * {+} How might warming affect us in the future?
* {+} Science can't tell us:
  * {+} Is climate change good or bad?
  * {+} What should we do about climate change?
* {+} Rather than debate the values (what should we do?), 
  <br/>some people reject the facts (what is happening?).

## Merchants of Doubt {#merchants data-transition="fade-out"}

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .eighty}
* A number of prominent physicists and chemists took money from big companies
  to sow doubt about science showing that ...
  * {+} smoking causes cancer
  * {+} burning coal causes "acid rain"
  * {+} chlorofluorocarbon chemicals were destroying the stratospheric ozone 
    layer
  * {+} burning fossil fuels causes global warming
* {+} The same scientists kept appearing in these different propadanda campaigns

## Merchants of Doubt {#merchants-2 data-transition="fade-in"}

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .eighty}
* In the 1980s, scientists working for big oil companies, like 
  Shell and Exxon, concluded that 
  burning fossil fuels would cause dangerous global warming
  * {+} The companies shut down the research
  * {+} Then they spent millions of dollars attacking climate science
    * {+} Exxon offered scientists $10,000 to write articles criticizing 
      scientific reports about climate change

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .eighty}
* {+} Sounds fancy. 
  * {+} It's one room in a farmhouse at the end of a road in rural Oregon.
  * {+} In 1998: 2 people: Arthur B. Robinson and his 21-year-old son
* {+} Circulated a document printed on glossy paper, typeset to look like an
  article from _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences_
  * {+} Claimed to prove that CO~2~ does not affect the climate
* {+} Arthur Robinson also says that nuclear radiation is good for you
  * And he has collected over 14,000 vials of human urine that he claims will
    extend his life and let him overthrow the 
    "medical-industrial-government complex."

## Oregon Petition {#oism-petition data-transition="fade-in"}

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .eighty}

* Asked readers to sign a petition saying that greenhouse gases do not affect
  the climate.
* {+} They claim that 31,487 scientists have signed the petition
  * {+} No attempt to verify identities or credentials
  * {+} Signatories include:
    * Characters from Star Wars
    * Characters from the TV show M\*A\*S\*H
    * Michael J. Fox and Ginger Spice
  * {+} Credentials included over 1,000 veterinarians
    * Almost all of the others claimed no expertise in climate science.
* {+} Several members of Congress cited the petition

# Recognizing Fallacies {#flicc-sec .center}

## Categories of Fallacies: FLICC {#flicc}

* People who reject climate science mostly use five categories of fallacies:
  * [**F**]{style="color:darkred;"}ake experts
  * [**L**]{style="color:darkred;"}ogical fallacies
  * [**I**]{style="color:darkred;"}mpossible expectations
  * [**C**]{style="color:darkred;"}herry picking
  * [**C**]{style="color:darkred;"}onspiracy theories

## Innoculation Theory

* Based on psychological research
* {+} Similar to vaccination against disease
* {+} Presenting a weakened form of misinformation helps people 
  recognize and resist propaganda
* {+} Two elements:
  * Warn people about misinformation
  * Explain how the misinformation is wrong
* {+} Facts vs. Logic
  * Facts can help you refute a single fallacy
  * Understanding the logic of fallacies helps you refute entire categories
    of misinformation

## Example: Fake Experts Fallacies

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![Add saying doctors smoke Camel cigarettes](assets/images/doctors-smoke-camels.jpg){style="width:100%;"}
:::
::: {.column}
![OISM climate petition card](assets/images/oism-petition-2.jpg){style="width:100%;"}

::: {.fragment .textleft}
In an experiment when participants are taught to see the Fake Expert fallacy
in a tobacco ad, they were much less likely to be fooled by climate 
misinformation that used the Fake Expert fallacy.
