# Modeling for<br/>Science vs. Policy  {#iams-sec .center data-transition="fade-out"}

## Modeling for Science vs. Policy  {#iams .ninety data-transition="fade-out"}

### Integrated Assessment Models (IAMS)

* {+} Combine climate system and world economy 
  * {+} Emissions as a consequence of economic activity
    * {+} Energy use for production (factories, etc.)
    * {+} Energy use for consumption (households, etc.)
    * {+} Farming: fertilizers, livestock, paddy fields, etc.
  * {+} Climatic impacts on economy
    * {+} Cost of severe weather
    * {+} Sea level rise
    * {+} Droughts & heat waves
    * {+} ...
* {+} **Optimize for greatest net economic output**
    
## Predictions & Projections  {#model-scenarios .eightyfive}

* Predictions are hard:
* {+} Biggest uncertainty in predicting future climates is GHG emissions
  *  {+} We can predict consequences of emissions
  *  {+} We can't predict what emissions will be
* {+} Projections:
  * {+} Conditional predictions: 
    * "**If** emissions do this, **then** climate will do that."
  * {+} Scenarios and Pathways of future emissions:
    * {+} **Scenario**: 
      * Start with a story of economic & political development
      * Calculate resulting emissions
    * {+} **Pathway**:
      * Start with possible emissions trajectory
      * Develop a plausible story that could produce it

## Decisions Under Uncertainty {#uncertainty style="font-size:66%;"}

* {+} **Global Climate change:**
  * Great Certainty:
    * People are warming the planet.
    * Warming will continue long after CO~2~ stops rising.
    * Changes will persist for thousands of years.
  * Uncertain:
    * How much will planet warm (factor of ~2).
* {+} **Impacts of Global Climate Change:**
  * Fairly Certain:
    * Severe heat waves will get worse.
    * Drought will get worse for much of the planet.
    * Intense rain & floods will get worse.
  * Very Uncertain:
    * Hurricanes & tornadoes.
* {+} **Local/Regional Climate Change**
  * Fairly certain about some detailed local impacts.
  * Enormously uncertain about others.


## Consequences of Climate Change  {#review_policy data-transition="fade"}

* **Economic effects:**
  * Costs of acting
  * Costs of inaction
  * Uncertainties
* **Policy issues:**
  * Markets vs. Regulation
    * Externalities
    * Kaya Identity: $F = P \times g \times e \times f$.

# Tipping points {#tipping-point-summary-sec .center data-transition="fade-out"}

## What we know about tipping points {#tipping-point-summary data-transition="fade-in"}

* {+} Very hard to predict them.
* {+} _Climate Casino_: important tipping points:
  * Ice sheet melting
  * Coral reefs
  * Tropical rain Forests
  * Runaway greenhouse gas release
  * Slowdown of ocean conveyor belt circulation
  * ...

## Hysteresis:<br/>Crossing Tipping Point  {#hysteresis-tip data-transition="fade"}

![](assets/fig/hysteresis_irreversible-1.png)

## Principles of Tipping Points {#tipping-principles .eighty}

* {+} Ordinary positive feedbacks amplify changes
  <br/>(hot &rarr; hotter, cold &rarr; colder).
  * Small positive feedbacks amplify but the _system remains stable_.
* {+} If positive feedbacks are too strong they become _self-perpetuating_.
  * Secondary forcing from feedback creates _unstoppable change_.
* {+} If feedback _strengthens with warming_:
  * Tipping point: feedback becomes strong enough<br/>to 
    continue warming independent of external forcing.
* {+} **Not all positive feedbacks have tipping points.**
* {+} **Hard to predict** when a positive feedback might go from
  _amplifying_ to _runaway_ (tipping point).

## Where are they?

* {+} *Climate Casino*: No big danger of fast tipping points if warming stays less than 3&deg;C
* {+} But, recent research finds that West Antarctic Ice Sheet has already crossed irreversible tipping point.

# What is the Scientific Consensus?  {#consensus-sec data-transition="fade-out" data-state="skip_slide"}

## What is the Scientific Consensus?  {#consensus-1 data-transition="fade"}

* {+} Is there a consensus?
* {+} If there is, should we trust it?

## What is the Scientific Consensus?  {#consensus-2 data-transition="fade-in"}

* {+} Is it important whether most scientists agree or not?
* {+} What if some scientists disagree?
* {+} Do most scientists agree?
  * {+} Careful reviews of scientific literature find 95% of scientists 
    publishing about climate change believe planet is warming because of human 
    activity.

## Meaning of Consensus

* {+} Does scientific consensus mean we can be<br/>100% certain that people are warming the planet?
* {+} What about the future impacts of climate change?

# What Gets in the Way of Policy?  {#policy-obs-sec data-transition="fade" data-state="skip_slide"}

## What Gets in the Way of Policy?  {#policy-obs data-transition="fade"}

* {+} Politicians don't understand science?
* {+} Public doesn't understand science?
* {+} Scientists don't understand politics?

## Issues for Policy  {#policy-obs-3}

* What do scientists agree on?
* {+} Should policy focus on limits to CO~2~ or \(\Delta T\)?
* {+} Should policy wait for better scientific certainty?
* {+} Uncertainty:
  * {+} How much warming is "dangerous"?
  * {+} How much CO~2~ would produce dangerous warming?
  * {+} Are there tipping points?
  * {+} If so, where are they?
* {+} Addressing uncertainty:
  * {+} Precautionary principle
    * _Better safe than sorry_
  * {+} No regrets policy
    * _Worth doing even if global warming turns out to be not so bad._

### **Carbon Dioxide and Climate:<br/>A Scientific Assessment**

::: {.ninety .textleft style="box-shadow:none;width:90%;margin:20px;font-size:90%;"}
The conclusions of this brief but intense investigation may be comforting to 
scientists but disturbing to policymakers. If carbon dioxide continues to 
increase, the study group finds no reason to doubt that climate changes will 
result and no reason to believe that these changes will be negligible. ...
