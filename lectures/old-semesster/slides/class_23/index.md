# Adding Up Damages  {#damages-sec .center}

## Risk Premiums

* {+} Why do people buy insurance?
* {+} Costs and benefits of insurance
  * {+} How does insurance company set premiums relative to expected payouts?
  * {+} On average do customers get more, less, or the same back as they paid in?
  * {+} So why does anyone buy insurance?
* {+} Is there a lesson here for climate policy?

## Overview of Damage Assessment  {#damage-overview .center .eightyfive}

* {+} Climate change is an externality:<br/>Unintended consequence of economic activity
* {+} Zero growth would dramatically slow warming
* {+} Climate change can slow future growth
  * {+} If climate change causes negative growth,<br/>
    economic calculations stop making sense
* {+} Converting unmanaged $\rightarrow$ managed systems reduces damage, vulnerability
* {+} Forecasting damage from climate change requires forecasting economies:
  * {+} How much of economy will be managed?
  * {+} What technology will be available to adapt & mitigate damage?
* {+} Value of non-economic goods<br/>(wilderness, ecosystems, biodiversity, ...)

## How much damage?  {#how.big  data-transition="convex-out"}

## Iron Law of Climate Policy {#iron-law .center}

* {+} People want action on global warming
* {+} But <span style="color:darkblue; font-weight:bold;">if climate policies conflict with economic growth, growth will win every time.</span>

## Frank Luntz (2010) {#luntz .center}

> What has changed is that the American economy went to hell. 
> And when you ask voters are they more concerned about 
> destroying their environment over the next 100 years or 
> rehabilitating their economy over the next 100 weeks, they'll
> choose the economy over the environment any day.

* Comparing actual trends for 2005--2017 to trends for 2005--2020 in 5
  emissions scenarios:
  * {+} Points above & right of the magenta line have higher emission trends 
    than historical
  * {+} Points below & left of the magenta line have lower emission trends than 
    historical

  than several scenarios including baseline (no policies) and RCP 6.0
  (business as usual with current policies).

## Summary

* Pielke and others were very pessimistic around 2010
* Ten years later:
  * Some reasons for greater optimism
  * But still cause for concern
