# Perspectives on<br/>Market-Based Regulations {.center}

## Market-Based Regulations {.eighty}

* Most economists (liberal & conservative) favor putting a price on
  greenhouse gas emissions.
  * {+} **Cap-and-trade:**
    * Require a permit for every ton of fossil fuels
    * Issue a limited number of permits
    * Companies can buy and sell permits
  * {+} **Carbon tax:**
    * Charge a tax on every ton of fossil fuels
    * Price equal to social cost of carbon emissions
  * {+} In principle, cap-and-trade and carbon tax are equivalent if 
    costs and benefits are known accurately.
    * M. Weitzman, 1974. "Prices vs. Quantities," _Rev. Econ. Studies_ 
      **41**, 477--491. <https://doi.org/10.2307/2296698>
    * {+} Different consequences for inaccuracies in costs or benefits.

## Considerations about Market-Based Regulations {.eighty}

* They work best when the total amount of pollution matters, but 
  it doesn't matter who emits it, or where.
  * {+} The impact is spread over large areas, regardless where the emissions 
    happen.
  * {+} Not appropriate when the biggest effects are local: 
    lead pollution, mercury from power plants, urban smog, ...
* {+} They work best when it's easy to monitor pollution and track the sources.
  * {+} Sulfur pollution (acid rain) was emitted from large power plants and
    factories.
  * {+} CO~2~ from fossil fuels: fossil fuel production is already 
    well-monitored
    * {+} If we had to monitor every car's tailpipe, it wouldn't work.
  * {+} Doesn't work for illegal dumping (pouring motor oil down sewer drains)
  * {+} The largest source of dioxin (a dangerous cancer-causing chemical) is 
    people in rural areas burning plastic trash in their back yards
* {+} Market-based regulations do not address the distribution of costs and 
  benefits:
  * One group may pay most of the costs and another may enjoy most
  of the benefits.
  * The distribution of costs may be regressive, with low-income people paying
  a disproportionate share.

## Optimum Emissions Abatement

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .ptop-3}
* Optimum emissions = E^\*^
* {+} EPA issues permits for E^\*^ tons of emissions
* {+} Free-trading in permits reduces emissions to E^\*^ at minimal cost
* {+} Total net benefits are maximized

# Uncertainty and Errors {.center}

## Market-Based Regulations and Uncertainty

* Cap-and-trade:
  * Maximum quantity of pollution is known
  * Cost to polluters is uncertain
* Emissions taxes
  * Cost to polluters is known
  * Quantity of pollution is uncertain

## Imperfect Emissions Abatement {#imperfect-abatement data-transition="fade-out"}

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .ptop-3 .eighty}
* Optimum emissions = E^\*^
* EPA underestimates benefits of emissions (cost of cutting emissions)
  * Issues permits for E' instead of E^\*^
:::

## Deadweight Losses {#deadweight-losses data-transition="fade"}

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .ptop-3 .eighty}
* Optimum emissions = E^\*^
* EPA underestimates benefits of emissions (cost of cutting emissions)
  * Issues permits for E' instead of E^\*^
* Deadweight loss (blue triangle) = difference between **actual net benefit**
  and **optimum net benefit**.

## Deadweight Loss with Carbon Tax {#deadweight-losses-tax data-transition="fade-in"}

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column .ptop-3 .eighty}
* Optimum emissions = E^\*^
  * This corresponds to a price P^\*^
* EPA overestimates benefits of emissions (cost of cutting emissions)
  * Sets the price at P' instead of P^\*^
  * Actual emissions are where the price P' intersects the actual benefit curve
* {+} When benefit curve is linear and steeper than the cost curve, then
  taxes produce better results under uncertainty
  * {+} Taxes may be worse if:
    * The cost curve is steeper than the benefit curve
    * or if the benefit or cost curve is sharply nonlinear near the optimum

# Market-Based Regulations in Action {.center}

## 1990 Clean Air Amendments

* {+} Acid rain, mostly from sulfate and nitrate chemicals emitted by burning 
  coal
* {+} Market-based regulation (cap-and-trade)
  * Permits sold at auction
  * Companies could buy and sell permits with each other
* {+} Environmentalists complained about selling the right to pollute
* {+} Industry groups worried permits would be too expensive

## How Things Went

* {+} Plan:
  * Gradually reduce emissions by 37% during 1990s
  * Big reductions start in 2000 to reduce pollution 70%
* {+} Predicted costs:
  * Industry: 
    * Regulation would cost \$3--7 billion per year in 1990s, 
    * \$7--25 billion per year after 2000
  * EPA: 
    * \$1.9--5.5 billion per year
* {+} Actual costs:
  * $0.8 billion per year during 1990s
  * $1 billion per year after 2000.
  * Emission reductions met 1999 goals in 1995, four years ahead of schedule.

## Broader Patterns in Environmental Regulation

* {+} An economic study of the costs of environmental regulations found:
  * 50% cost at least 25% less than predicted
  * 40% cost roughly as much as predicted
  * 10% cost at least 25% more than predicted
* {+} A 2017 audit of the Clean Air Act by the Office of Management and Budget 
  under President Donald Trump found that out of 55 clean-air regulations
  they studied, 
  * 46 had benefits that were greater than the costs 
  * Only 2 had costs greater than the benefits.
* {+} A 2003 report from the Office of Management and Budget under President
  George H.W. Bush found that clean-air regulations produced benefits between
  3 and 4 times greater than the costs of compliance.

* {+} Benefits depend on which company produces the emissions
* {+} Costs only depend on the total emissions
* {+} Put emissions in descending order of marginal benefit.
* {+} What is the optimum emissions level?
* {+} What is the optimum emissions tax?
