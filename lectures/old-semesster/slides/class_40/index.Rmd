## Psychological Heuristics {#heuristics .eightyfive}

* Solution aversion:

  > If a solution is unpalatable, deny the problem exists.

* Motivated reasoning:

  > Desire to reach a certain conclusion leads to biased and selective 
  > examination of evidence

* Cultural cognition:

  > Credibility of expertise depends on perception of shared values.
  >
  > Trust is based on feeling someone would understand what's important to you.
  >
  > Someone who shares your cultural roots.

## Solution Aversion

> global warming and all that, I assumed that that was probably right until
> I found out what it was going to cost.

## Problems with Policy Approach So Far {#problems-so-far}

* {+} Focus on **best** solutions (e.g., carbon tax)
* {+} Emphasis on how well it will work when put into practice
* {+} Neglects how hard it is to get government to adopt best solutions
  * "Political opportunity cost"
* {+} Second-best or third-best may be easier to enact quickly

  >    plan executed next week_

# Private Governance {#private-governance-sec .center}

## Private Environmental Governance {#private-governance}

* **Actor:**
  * Government &rarr; Private organization
* **Action:**
  * Law, policy &rarr; Private initiative

## Corporate Initiatives {#corporate-initiatives}

* Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)
  * 10,000 companies have dislosed their greenhouse gas emissions, 
  * Used by investors with $106 trillion in assets
  * Participating companies reduced their emissions by 522 million tons 
    CO~2~e in 2018
* Two thirds of the S&P 500 have set climate or clean-energy targets
* Over 20 major insurance companies limit sales to fossil-fuel intensive 
  companies

## Specifics {#specifics}

* WalMart pledged 1 billion tons CO~2~e emissions cuts through 2030
* Microsoft has been 100% carbon neutral since 2012
  * Pledged to remove all its past CO~2~ emissions by 2050
* Google went carbon-neutral in 2017
  * Pledged to power all operations with renewable energy by 2030
  * Investing in 5 billion watss of renewable power
  * Will work with 500 cities to reduce their emissions by more than 
    1 billion tons/year

# Policy Analysis for Private Governance {.center data-state="skip_slide" data-transition="fade"}

## Principles of Private Governance Analysis

* **Technical Potential**

  > Reduction if everyone takes action

* Behavioral Plasticity

  > What fraction of actors would take action with appropriate incentives?

* Policy Plasticity

  > Potential for public or private actors to provide incentives

## Corporate Pressure to Adopt Green Energy

::::::::: {.columns}
:::::: {.column}

* Southeastern states:
  * Hostile to renewable energy
  * Heavy coal use
* {+} Corporate pressure
  * Offer big data center, but only if renewable energy is available
  * Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft
* {+} Over 1000 MW new renewable power planned for NC, TN, VA

## Diet and Climate

* Livestock produce 14--18% of greenhouse gas emissions
  * Beef and lamb are much worse than other kinds of meat
* {+} Employers motivating employees to eat less meat:
  * {+} WeWork requires all business meals to be vegan
  * {+} Copenhagen Business School makes vegetarian meals the default.
    * Employees can opt-out and order meat
    * 90% of meals were vegetarian
    * Employees voted to keep the program
  * {+} Google is studying what motivations work best to reduce employee meat consumption
  * {+} Burger King, White Castle, other chains add meatless burgers
* {+} Plant-based products could replace 10% of global meat market by 2030
  * This would reduce emissions by 750 million tons CO~2~-equivalent

## Principles for Policy Design

1. Prioritize high-impact actions
2. {+} Financial assistance
   * An action may save money in the long run, but a household may not have 
     money today
3. {+} Publicize the program
4. {+} Provide valid information from a credible source at points of 
   decision
   * You may want to buy the more environmentally friendly product, but 
     when you're at the stor, you need to be able to quickly figure out which 
     product is better.
5. {+} Keep it simple and convenient
6. {+} Provide quality assurance

## Private Governance {#walmart-bulbs .eighty}

* {+} 2007: WalMart sets and exceeds goal of selling 100 compact fluorescent 
  light bulbs in one year.
  * {+} Meets goal in 10 months
* {+} 2011: WalMart launches competition among suppliers:
  * {+} Best high-quality LED bulb under $10:
  We will help you sell hundreds of millions!
* {+} 2013: WalMart teams up with TCP to launch 60W equivalent bulb for less than $9
* {+} Replacing 5 most used bulbs in your house with LEDs will save around $75/year

# Conclusions {.center}

## Conclusions

* {+} Political gridlock threatens public governance
  * {+} Most policy analysis ignores political feasibility
* {+} Private governance can likely reduce global emissions by more than 
  1 billion tons per year rapidly
* {+} This isn't even close to solving the whole climate problem
* {+} But it can help considerably, and buy time to enact other measures.
* {+} May promote bipartisan agreemenet about climate science
  * But may polarize views about private businesses engaging in governance
